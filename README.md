# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Vinicius Cavalcante

Senior AI Engineer with 5+ years of experience building scalable AI-driven systems, APIs, and web applications.

My expertise is in engineering end-to-end Generative AI solutions, from large-scale data scraping to building and deploying RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines. I am proficient in **Python**, **Langchain**, **FastAPI**, **MongoDB (Atlas Vector Search)**, and **React**, with a strong background in DevOps, CI/CD, and cloud platforms.
