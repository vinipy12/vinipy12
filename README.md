## ðŸš€ Professional Experience
Currently working at a startup as Senior Full Stack Engineer, where I've:
- Developed and launched a RAG system handling over 5M documents, optimizing MongoDB indexes and retrieval techniques for sub-10-second search responses
- Integrated third-party AI services like Cohere for embeddings/reranking and Gemini for chatting, refactoring code for efficient Heroku deployment
- Built full-stack applications using React for frontend and FastAPI/MongoDB for backend, serving high-traffic user bases
- Previously at Sidia Instituto de CiÃªncia e Tecnologia:
  - Designed RESTful APIs serving 500+ daily users
  - Reduced process execution times by 30% through optimization
  - Built CI/CD pipelines cutting deployment times by 40%
  - Boosted test coverage to 80% across applications

## ðŸ”¥ Recent Projects
### ðŸ¤– RAG System for Large-Scale Document Retrieval
Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain, Ollama local models, and cloud-hosted models. Integrated Cohere for embeddings/reranking and Gemini for chatting. Optimized for a 5M+ document MongoDB collection with advanced indexing and retrieval techniques, deployed on Heroku with refactored architecture for scalability and low latency.

### ðŸ”„ CRM Backend System
A scalable Django backend with RESTful APIs deployed on AWS EC2 using Docker. Implemented AWS SES integration for notifications and secure IAM roles for access control.

### ðŸ”¬ COVID-19 Detection CNN
Developed a convolutional neural network achieving 92% accuracy in detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images using Python, Keras, and TensorFlow.

### ðŸš§ Scalable Microservice API (In Progress)
Building a high-performance Go microservice with PostgreSQL and Redis caching, focusing on low-latency responses and scalability.

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning
- MLOps practices for AI deployment and monitoring
- Fine-tuning RAG models for improved accuracy and precision
- Advanced Kubernetes orchestration
- System Design for distributed AI applications
